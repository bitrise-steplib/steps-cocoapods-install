title: Run CocoaPods install
summary: |-
  You don't need to keep the installed pods in your repo. Simply add this Step
  and Bitrise will do the pod install for you on the VM!
description: |-

  CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C projects. This Step uses CocoaPods' `pod install` command to install your dependencies on the virtual machine where your Bitrise build runs.   
  CocoaPods version is determined based on the Podfile.lock file or on the Gemfile.lock file. If your Gemfile.lock file contains the `cocoapods` gem then the step will call `pod install` with `bundle exec`. Otherwise, the Cocoapods version in the Podfile.lock will be installed as a global gem.
  If no Cocoapods version is defined in Podfile.lock or Gemfile.lock, the preinstalled sytem Cocoapods version will be used.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the **Source Code Directory path** to the path of your app's source code.

  1. Optionally, provide a Podfile in the **Podfile path** input.

     Without a specific Podfile, the Step does a recursive search for the Podfile in the root of your app's directory, and uses the first Podfile it finds.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If the Step fails, check out the Podfile and the Gemfile of your app. Make sure there is no compatibility issue with the different versions of your Pods.  
  Check that both Podfile.lock and Gemfile.lock is committed and the Cocoapods versions defined in both match.

  You can set the **Execute cocoapods in verbose mode?** input to true to get detailed logs of the Step.
